Hi my name is Sean Mowrey and I am a Honors Mechanical Engineering Student at the University of Waterloo. I'm from the west coast but am a Calgary Flames(2018 Stanley Cup Champions just in case you didn't know) fan. My favorite sport is Hockey which I played competitively up until Junior B a few years ago. Now I can be found at the weight room and ping pong tables of my residence. I love to build things and solve problems using my hands, computer, brain and err stomach...Thanks for reading this, reach out to me if you have any questions or want to talk! :)
