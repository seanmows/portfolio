The title seemed like a good fit to my first blog post.

Hello to all the readers out there if there are any.

'Cricket' 'Cricket'

Well anyways, today will be my last day in Vancouver before I head to University. I am filled with both excitement and anxiety of moving away but I'm sure everything will work out. This will be where I am going to start blogging and presenting myself. It may change in the future but for now this is all I could whip up in the short time before School. A technical piece on the actual website design will come at a later date.

Thanks for reading, don't be afraid to contact me or comment below to start a discussion.
